# Iris_flower_project
The project is about classification of data set using SVC machine learning algorithm. We will design a model which is capable of classifying the flower into different classes based on its features. We will use SVC as a classifying algorithm in order to classify our data set into 3 classes namely- SESTOSA , VERSICOLOR ,  VIRGINICA.
